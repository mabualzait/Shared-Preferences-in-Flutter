# Shared Preferences in Flutter using Dart programming language

in thie repo you will find the code for the Shared preferences lecture in the Flutter Course.

## what we will learn in this example 
this tutorial will lead you to create your first shared preferences project where you can read and write to it. 

examples of using shared preferences:- 
- if you want your users to login just one time then keep them loggedin you can use shared preferences to save for example a boolean value indicates that the user is already loggedin and everytime the user opens the application you will redirect it to the Main Activity or screen directly, otherwise he will be redirected to the login page! 

- Another usage we see always in the games speacially the high score, so you can keep this information in the shared preferences and it will be loaded whenever you need it very quickly from the shared preferences. 

- we may also use the shared preferences in the preferences screen e.g. audio, language, user preferences settings page.
